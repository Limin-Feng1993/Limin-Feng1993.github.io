**Checklist of writing a scientific story:**

- Fight the pressure to publish prematurely. One good paper can launch a career; many mediate ones build a rather different one.    
             
- The simpler an idea is at its core, the larger its swath of influence. Brevity is the soul of wit.
- Incremental science can be important, but really good papers go beyond incremental to novel: they say something new and unexpected.

- Identifying a knowledge gap creates curiosity. Filling that gap creates novelty. It is better to fill a small knowledge gap than none at all.

- Initial impressions are strong and lasting. Your first sentences get readers moving and set the direction.

- You must convince us of the importance of the problem, you must show us what we don’t know and why it is important.

- You have a question that drove your work. Make it clear. Then you can tell us how you answer it.

- Well begun is half done. Ending well is the best revenge. 

- It’s okay to write point-first paragraphs, and it’s okay to write point-last paragraphs, but don’t write point-nowhere paragraphs.

- Whatever you put at the beginning of a sentence, readers interpret as the topic. The last words carry the greatest weight. 

- The longer the gap between actor and action, the duller and more confusing a sentence becomes.

- Writing in a heavy academic style also identifies us as members of the club, but one increasingly isolated from broader society. 

- Written English is different from spoken English, but the difference should be primarily in sentence structure, not vocabulary. 

- Strong, clear nouns and verbs give writing power,  eliminating unnecessary adjectives and adverbs will make your writing stronger and tighter.

- When you develop the courage and ability to ask new questions and take the risks to answer them, you will be prepared to do cuttingedge science.

- Even answering an old question with new technology won’t make the science novel. Leading journals look for new knowledge and understanding. 

- In the modern world with search engines and open-access journals, good papers will be found and cited regardless of where they are published.

- If you’ve found the novelty, you’ve done the hardest part. It’s only after this that specific language skills matter. 

- People are looking for application: what can we do with that understanding?

- Every suggestion above has been at the heart of communicating to non-scientists.

- The PhD degree you have struggled for meant nothing; it was just an entry ticket to the new arena. Indeed, all graduations are commencements.

- As a scientist, you are a professional writer. Focus on success strategies and ignore survival suggestions.

- You may survive by publishing a lot of papers, but you will only succeed by telling a compelling story. Good luck and good writing.
